            <h2>"La Belle Verte"</h3> 1996
            <p>The "Green Planet" belongs to another solar system. Through the simplicity of their lifestyle those who live there are a real step ahead of us: they spend their time concentrating their knowledge, strength and energy on the development of their minds and bodies in a natural environment which they dearly preserve and care for. Once a year, they gather in the crater of a dormant volcano to decide which planets they ought to send messengers to. There are volunteers for every planet except Earth, which is considered too polluted and too dangerous. One woman alone, Mila, decides to go there to seek out her identity, as Osam the old sage has revealed to her that she was conceived there during a previous trip by her father.</p> —Polly_Kat

            <h2>"Human"</h3> 2015
            <p>Human, like its director, is many things. A sweeping three hour plus surge through the voiceless (the original cut ran to 12 hours), it raises issues from gender discrimination to sexuality, violence, poverty and everything between, divided by the stunning aerial photography that first made Yann Arthus-Bertrand’s name. A documentary of graceful simplicity opening windows to multiple worlds we know about but rarely see, it’s emotionally complex agitprop, a guttural roar to action smoothed over with high definition photography capturing every ridge and hollow on the face of participants.</p> —Stephen_Mayne

            <h2>"Fantastic Fungi"</h3> 2019
            <p>One of the many, many facts that you will ingest in Louie Schwartzberg’s documentary Fantastic Fungi is that there are more than 1.5 million species of yeasts, molds, and mushrooms on this particular planet; and while a good deal of them can be deadly, the majority of them are basically, in a wonderfully clandestine manner, maintaining and repairing our ecosystem, despite humanity’s best intentions to destroy it. Focusing on the ways in which various fungi are a vital part of the cycle of life, as it were, our main tour guide is one Paul Stamets, a mycologist who stomps around various forests and upends deadfall branches to find these things that he is obviously obsessed with (he also sells them, by the way, but we all have to hustle). And as with any subculture, the people who are obsessed? Well, they are really obsessed.</p> —Josh_Kupecki

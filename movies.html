              <h2>"La Belle Verte"</h3>
              <p>Director: Coline Serreau, 1996</p>
              <p><q>The "Green Planet" belongs to another solar system. Through the simplicity of their lifestyle those who live there are a real step ahead of us: they spend their time concentrating their knowledge, strength and energy on the development of their minds and bodies in a natural environment which they dearly preserve and care for. Once a year, they gather in the crater of a dormant volcano to decide which planets they ought to send messengers to. There are volunteers for every planet except Earth, which is considered too polluted and too dangerous. One woman alone, Mila, decides to go there to seek out her identity, as Osam the old sage has revealed to her that she was conceived there during a previous trip by her father.

            <h2>"Human"</h2>
              <p>Director: Yann Arthus-Bertrand, 2015  </p>
              <p><q>I am deeply taken with traditional music, it moves me, it connects you to emotion. The idea with HUMAN was to create songs that would reflect the same emotion generated by the interviews. I wanted things to open up, to open up one’s heart, to let the sadness be without any restraint. HUMAN has been one of these rare moments in my life as a film composer during which I could express all these different cultures at the same time : either working on minimalist songs or meeting with these singers and musicians coming from all around the world. Which note did I first produce ? I had more like a global vision in mind, an atmosphere that would merge into the film and that would bring people together, this was my starting point. The part I created for the Mongolian sequence might be the best summary of the atmosphere I wanted the film to have. Yann has given me a particular role as a film composer that is very diffrent from the one other directors usually give me. There is a strong friendship between us, an intimate relationship. He’s generous. You follow him because of his fantastic instinct, I can advise on the artistic process being in a way the first audience.

            <h2>"Fantastic Fungi"</h2>
              <p>Director: Louis Schwartzberg, 2019  </p>
              <p><q>One of the many, many facts that you will ingest in Louie Schwartzberg’s documentary Fantastic Fungi is that there are more than 1.5 million species of yeasts, molds, and mushrooms on this particular planet; and while a good deal of them can be deadly, the majority of them are basically, in a wonderfully clandestine manner, maintaining and repairing our ecosystem, despite humanity’s best intentions to destroy it. Focusing on the ways in which various fungi are a vital part of the cycle of life, as it were, our main tour guide is one Paul Stamets, a mycologist who stomps around various forests and upends deadfall branches to find these things that he is obviously obsessed with (he also sells them, by the way, but we all have to hustle). And as with any subculture, the people who are obsessed? Well, they are really obsessed.

            <h3>"One Breath Around the World"</h3>
              <p>Director: Guillaume Néry, 2019</p>
              <p><q>Dances with whales: the ethereal underwater vistas of an elite freediving team. One Breath Around the World is the latest
              aquatic spectacle from the French freediving champion Guillaume Néry, and his partner, the French freediver, underwater filmmaker and dancer Julie Gautier. Without the aid of supplied air, Néry plunges into the ocean’s hidden depths, revealing remarkable views of marine geology and wildlife around the globe. Seamlessly transitioning between a range of underwater realms, the video gives the impression that Néry’s journey is taken in a single breath. With stunning camerawork by Gautier, who also held her breath while filming, the duo prove themselves expert explorers of not only water, but space and perspective as well, making these grand underwater landscapes appear almost alien. For more phenomenal freediving, watch Gautier’s extraordinary underwater dance Ama.

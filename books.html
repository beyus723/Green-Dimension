                <h3>"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth"</h3>
                <p>Author(s): James Lovelock, 1979</p>
                <p>"In Gaia, James Lovelock puts forward his idea that life on Earth functions as a single organism and is self-regulating. In the 30 years since his hypothesis was first published, many of his predictions have come true and his theory continues to be debated.
                Firstly, Lovelock explains the idea behind Gaia and then considers the evidence to support his hypothesis. The text looks at the history of the Earth and how all living creatures have had an impact on the planet. In doing so, it raises awareness of how inter-related life on the planet is, and how our actions can cause indirect effects.

                The chapters are short and concise, making Gaia an easy read. Although the book uses scientific evidence to support the hypothesis, the information and ideas are clearly presented for non-scientists.

                As a result of the text being 30-years-old, some of the facts and theories are outdated but the author acknowledges these in the new preface as well as outlining the present state of the debate.

                Gaia is highly recommended, firstly because of its interesting and thought-provoking ideas, and secondly due to its significance to modern day thinking around the environment and climate change."

                <p>Author(s): Peter Tompkins & Christopher Bird, 1973 </p>
                <p>In 1973, a book claiming that plants were sentient beings that feel emotions, prefer classical music to rock and roll, and can respond to the unspoken thoughts of humans hundreds of miles away landed on the New York Times best-seller list for nonfiction. “The Secret Life of Plants,” by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, presented a beguiling mashup of legitimate plant science, quack experiments, and mystical nature worship that captured the public imagination at a time when New Age thinking was seeping into the mainstream.

                <h2>"Fantastic Fungi"</h2>
                <p>Director: Louis Schwartzberg, 2019 </p>
                <p><q>One of the many, many facts that you will ingest in Louie Schwartzberg’s documentary Fantastic Fungi is that there are more than 1.5 million species of yeasts, molds, and mushrooms on this particular planet; and while a good
                    deal of them can be deadly, the majority of them are basically, in a wonderfully clandestine manner, maintaining and repairing our ecosystem, despite humanity’s best intentions to destroy it. Focusing on the ways in which various
                    fungi are a vital part of the cycle of life, as it were, our main tour guide is one Paul Stamets, a mycologist who stomps around various forests and upends deadfall branches to find these things that he is obviously obsessed with
                    (he also sells them, by the way, but we all have to hustle). And as with any subculture, the people who are obsessed? Well, they are really obsessed.

                <h3>"La Belle Verte"</h3>
                  <p>Director: Coline Serreau, 1996</p>
                  <p><q>The "Green Planet" belongs to another solar system. Through the simplicity of their lifestyle those who live there are a real step ahead of us: they spend their time concentrating their knowledge, strength and energy on the
                      development of their minds and bodies in a natural environment which they dearly preserve and care for. Once a year, they gather in the crater of a dormant volcano to decide which planets they ought to send messengers to. There
                      are volunteers for every planet except Earth, which is considered too polluted and too dangerous. One woman alone, Mila, decides to go there to seek out her identity, as Osam the old sage has revealed to her that she was
                      conceived there during a previous trip by her father.
